==Library Foundation==
The basic functionality built into the library is a dynamic variable, or options, system. Using this
funcationality, one can create options at runtime. These are stored in a way
that makes it simple to use them as arguments for your own components or third-party ones.

The second base functionality for the library is enhanced behavior functionality. Behaviors
attached to the base components can have their own options. In addition, behavior variables may be accessed
directly by the owner of the behavior with the need for a behavior prefix:

===Without psYiiExtensions...===
{{{
//	Create a component and attach a behavior
$oComp = new CComponent();
$oComp->attachBehavior( 'myBehavior', '''x.y.z.behavior' );

//	Access a behavior property
$oComp->myBehavior->propertyName
}}}

===With psYiiExtensions...===
{{{
//	Create a component, CPSComponentBehavior is automatically attached
$oComp = new CPSComponent();

//	Access CPSComponentBehavior::internalName property
echo $oComp->internalName;
}}}
